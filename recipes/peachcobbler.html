    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>A slow cooker is easy. That’s why everyone loves them. For lazy cooks, like myself, slow cookers are a cook’s best friend. The only real challenge is getting it out of the cabinet. And if you like to bake, this slow cooker peach cobbler recipe is one of the easiest recipes you could make. </p>
